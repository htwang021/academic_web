This project develops machine learning (ML) models to predict cancer survivability with a focus on fairness and explainability, using data from the [SEER](https://seer.cancer.gov/data/). It addresses the need for tailored predictions that consider the different stages of several cancers, particularly bladder, breast, and prostate cancers.
